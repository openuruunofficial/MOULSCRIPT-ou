About Non-Free Libraries:

This software uses some non-free libraries for which exceptions appear in the
source code license inserts. It is suggested that anyone who thinks of doing
substantial further work on this program should first free it from dependence
on the non-free libraries so that it does the same job without the non-free
libraries. Further introduction of non-free libraries likely would require a
revised license and thus permission from all contributors to the codebase.
That being problematic, any additional non-free libraries are unlikely to be
accepted by Cyan Worlds or the development community.
